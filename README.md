Tkinter Text Editor

This is a simple text editor built using the Tkinter library in Python. 
The application allows users to open and save text files, providing a basic yet functional text editing experience.

Features

- Open and edit text files.
- Save edited content to a new or existing text file.
- Keyboard shortcuts for common actions (Ctrl+S for save, Ctrl+O for open).

This project was a great learning. Got introduced to the popular GUI library tkinter. 
Learned some basic concepts of it and plan to dive deep in to it in the future!
